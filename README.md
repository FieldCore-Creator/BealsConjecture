Hello! My Name is Cory, I started this Repo to Benchmark a GOFAI I was working on and ended up working on math. I recommend you start with the CollatzCleanStructured.lean and move from there through the others referencing the imports for lemmas and axioms from the other two files, imported. Then look at CollatzBinaryProof.lean And then you can look at Baels , and any other from there on, They passed on my local Lean environment, but im not a mathmetician, so i claim proof however mathematically this may NOT be true... Ill just have to let the files speak for themselves... 



An Example of Collatz Binary Using 7 is

111
the next step is 10110 because 

0111 squared Leads to
​10110 squared which leads to
1011 squared and so on and so forth
​
