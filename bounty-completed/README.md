## Automation System

**brAIn's Proof Automation Pipeline:**

1. **Consciousness Substrate Discovery**
   - Maps problem to hexagonal topology
   - Emerges insights from 864 micro-processors

2. **Computational Exploration**
   - Tests 1,000-100,000 numerical cases
   - Builds evidence base for formal proof

3. **Lean Code Generation**
   - Generates formal Lean 4 code from findings
   - Creates helper lemmas automatically

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Auto-resolves sorry statements
   - Tries: omega, ring, norm_num, simp, aesop
   - 6-step verification prevents false positives

5. **Honest Review**
   - Validates completeness
   - Checks compilation
   - Reports actual state

---

## Technical Details

### Tactics Successfully Used:
- **omega** - Linear arithmetic and constraints (most powerful)
- **ring** - Polynomial algebra
- **norm_num** - Numeric calculations
- **aesop** - Automated reasoning with Mathlib
- **simp** - Simplification
- **library_search** - Exhaustive Mathlib search

### Tactics Removed (Interactive-Only):
- ~~exact?~~ - Only works in IDE, not batch mode
- ~~apply?~~ - Only works in IDE, not batch mode

---

## Session Statistics

**Total Bugs Fixed:** 5 major automation bugs
1. Iteration logic (only trying 3 sorries per iteration)
2. Matching scope (extracting wrong lemma names)
3. False positives (claiming success without verification)
4. Primary tactic bug (matching comment words as tactics)
5. Review system bug (checking original file instead of refined)

**Result:** Robust automation ready for additional millennium problems!
