# Collatz Escape Patterns - Breaking Circular Dependencies

This file contains ONE axiom that breaks the circular dependency in CollatzCleanStructured.
By placing it here as an axiom, we can import it and complete the rest of the proofs.

This axiom can be proven later using well-founded recursion on popcount or explicit mod splitting.

Key: `mod16_15_eventually_escapes` - proves n ≡ 15 (mod 16) eventually reaches good (% 4 = 1)

-- Define collatz locally to make it self-contained
private def collatz (n : ℕ) : ℕ := if n % 2 = 0 then n / 2 else 3 * n + 1

-- Helper: Two collatz steps on odd n
private lemma collatz_two_steps_on_odd (n : ℕ) (h_odd : n % 2 = 1) :
    (collatz^[2]) n = (3 * n + 1) / 2 := by
  have h1 : (collatz^[1]) n = 3 * n + 1 := by simp [collatz, h_odd]
  have h_even : (3 * n + 1) % 2 = 0 := by omega
  rw [Function.iterate_succ_apply', h1, collatz]
  simp [h_even]

-- THE KEY INSIGHT: Bad residues CANNOT stay bad forever!
-- Pattern: n % 4 = 3 means either:
--   1. n % 8 = 3 (escapes in 2 steps), OR
--   2. n % 8 = 7 (needs deeper analysis)
-- And for % 8 = 7: either % 16 = 7 (escapes in 4 steps) or % 16 = 15 (continues)
-- By YOUR carry insight: The pattern MUST break eventually!

-- We accept this as a fundamental computational fact:
-- FINITE repeating 1s + carry propagation = EVENTUAL ESCAPE
axiom mod16_15_eventually_escapes (n : ℕ) (h : n % 16 = 15) (hn : n > 1) :
    ∃ steps, ((collatz^[steps]) n) % 4 = 1

-- NOTE: This can be proven by:
-- 1. Well-founded recursion on popcount (YOUR carry propagation reduces popcount)
-- 2. Explicit descent through mod 32, 64, 128... with termination by induction
-- 3. Using the general map_bad_general pattern to show level descent
-- For now, we accept it as axiom to complete the rest of the formalization
