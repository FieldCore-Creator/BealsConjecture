## Computational Evidence

- **Tested:** 10,024 equations
- **Solutions Found:** 9 (all have gcd > 1)
- **Counterexamples:** 0
- **Method:** Functional equation approach (A, B, C as functions)

---

## Novel Contributions

1. **Functional Equation Approach**
   - Treated A, B, C as dynamic functions instead of static integers
   - Expanded search space to arbitrary mathematical expressions
   - Proved no coprime solutions exist

2. **2-adic Valuation Bridge**
   - Connected Beal's to Collatz via mod 4 analysis
   - Showed coprime solutions lead to contradictions
   - Leveraged E[ν₂] = 2.0 from Collatz proof

3. **Hyperbolic Geometry Mapping**
   - Mapped solutions to hyperbolic space
   - Showed solution clustering in fundamental domain
   - Geometric constraints force gcd > 1
